# DMS-Project---IMDB

1
Overview
We provide a set of files here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4t1oOFzubodRmZhV1NoOG1DWDQ/view
Each file comprises the tuples of one relation; the relations, together, model the data from the Internet
movie database (IMDB, in short). The smallest has 4 tuples; the largest has more than 5 million
tuples. The data files have a total size of a few Gigabytes. You will have to:
1. Load each separate file into a table in Postgres; you will have to create the tables with the appropri-
ate key and foreign key constraints. Loading the data is not trivial and may take some time, both
to get it right, and then to run (actually load data into the server). For this, you will have to pro-
vide the commands that you used.
2. Write queries for specific tasks. For this, you will have to provide: the queries; their results; some
query plans; and suggestions to improve performance.
